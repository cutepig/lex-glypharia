# Lex Glypharia

Lex Glypharia is an online tool intended to help translating Egyptian hieroglyph texts.

On the left you can find a hieroglyph writing area and a keyboard section that can be used to enter hieroglyphs into the writing area. When you select text in this writing area, the selected text will be looked up from a dictionary and the results are shown on the bottom right area. Matching the words will be done from the beginning of the selection to either the end of the selection or the longest match. Results will be ordered with the longest matches first. The upper right section can be used to write down translations or other notes (hint: you can copy-paste hieroglyphs from the hieroglyph writing area).
